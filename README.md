#### Running JavaScript Files in Node.js
To run a JavaScript file in Node.js, follow these steps:
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the JavaScript file using the `cd` command.
    ```
    cd path/to/directory
    ```
3. Run the JavaScript file using Node.js. For example, if the file is named `example.js`, you can run it with:
    ```
    node example.js
    ```

#### Running Jest Test Files
If you have Jest installed globally, navigate to the directory containing your test files and run:
understanding.
```
jest filename.test.js
```
Replace `filename.test.js` with the name of your test file.

Alternatively, if Jest is installed locally in your project, you can use `npx` to run Jest without installing it globally:
```
npx jest filename.test.js
```
